# FinalOfADS
This is my final project of a advanced data science course. Which I learned so many machine learning algorithms and deep learning rnn by applying the yelp data into those models.
## Repository
* EDA file contains a jupyter file of our EDA for yelp business data
* Machine Learning File contains a jupyter file of applying various machine learning algorithms to yelp reviews data (Natural Language Processing)
## Dataset
* All of the data we used are from yelp dataset challange Round 11
* * You can get it online and put them in a folder named "dataset" at the same location with the jupyter file
* * The EDA file used the csv version of the data and the ML used json version of the dataset.
* * Or you can download the zip file from this google drive link and download it in the same directory with the jupyter file: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ub8DIREZPbCB8BKtsViHlIxLKf3c6inR?usp=sharing


## Deep Learning
* We applied RNN with LSTM in our natural language processing trip with yelp reviews data which can be found on databricks through: https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/2343189024242557/156494814133117/5587771442618921/latest.html
* We also applied machine learning with more reviews data on databricks: https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/2343189024242557/3504901743907501/5587771442618921/latest.html
